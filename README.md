# TERM-DEPOSIT-PREDICTION-USING-RANDOM-FORESR
Prediction of whether the customer has subscribed to a term deposit or not using Random Forest
A term deposit, also known as a fixed deposit or time deposit, is a type of financial investment where an individual deposits a sum of money with a financial institution for a specified period of time. The money is invested at a fixed interest rate, and the depositor agrees not to withdraw the funds until the maturity date.
Software used :Anaconda, Jupyter notebook.
Algorithm used: Random Forest
How to:
1.Read the csv file using pandas read_csv() function.
2.Apply different Data preprocessing technique to clean the data. 
3.Divide data set into x and y; x having independents value and y having dependents variables.
4.Further dividing x and y into x_test, x_train and y_test, y_train respectively using train_test_split().
5.Importing and applying Random Forest model from sklearn.
6.Predict the result giving all independent values as input to the model..
